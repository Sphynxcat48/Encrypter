1. Make the textbox bigger
2. Rotate the checkmark
3. Potentially change the checkmark gyphicon to something more clear or even just rotate-able
4. Lower/center the text on the main screen
5. Add credits to glyphicons - Bootstrap includes 260 glyphs from the Glyphicon Halflings set. Glyphicons Halflings are normally not available for free, but their creator has made them available for Bootstrap free of cost. As a thank you, you should include a link back to Glyphicons (https://glyphicons.com) whenever possible.
